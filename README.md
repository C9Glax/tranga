<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Tranga can download Chapters and Metadata from Scanlation sites such as 

- [MangaDex.org](https://mangadex.org/)
- [Manganato.com](https://manganato.com/)
- [Mangasee](https://mangasee123.com/)

and automatically start updates in [Komga](https://komga.org/) and [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) to import them.

### Inspiration:

Because [Kaizoku](https://github.com/oae/kaizoku) was relying on [mangal](https://github.com/metafates/mangal) and mangal
hasn't received bugfixes for it's issues with Titles not showing up, or throwing errors because of illegal characters,
there were no alternatives for automatic downloads. However [Kaizoku](https://github.com/oae/kaizoku) certainly had a great Web-UI.

That is why I wanted to create my own project, in a language I understand, and that I am able to maintain myself.

- Newtonsoft.JSON
- [PuppeteerSharp](https://www.puppeteersharp.com/)
- [Html Agility Pack (HAP)](https://html-agility-pack.net/)
- Love <3 Blåhaj 🦈

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There is two release types:

- CLI
- Docker

### CLI

Head over to [releases](https://git.bernloehr.eu/glax/Tranga/releases) and download. The CLI will guide you through setup.

### Docker

Download [docker-compose.yaml](https://git.bernloehr.eu/glax/Tranga/src/branch/master/docker-compose.yaml) and configure to your needs.

Wherever you are mounting `/usr/share/Tranga-API` you also need to mount that same path + `/imageCache` in the webserver container.

### Usage

There is two ways to download Mangas:
- Downloading everything and monitor for new Chapters
- Selecting specific Volumes/Chapters

On the website you add new tasks, by selecting the blue '+' field. Next select the connector/site you want to use, and enter a search term.
After pressing 'Search', the results will be presented below - this might, depending on the result-size, take a while.
Next select the publication and a new popup will open with two options:
- "Monitor" - Download all chapters and monitor for new ones
- "Download Chapter" - Download specific chapters only

When selecting `Monitor` you will be presented with a new window and the selection of the interval you want to check for new chapters.
When selecting `Download Chapter` a list will open with all available chapters from which you can then select a range.

The syntax for selecting chapters is as follows:
- To download a single Chapter enter either the index number (the number at the very start of the line) or its absolute number like so: `c(h)(apter)[number]`, spaces are allowed.
- To download a range of chapters enter either a range of index numbers (`3-6`) or chapters (`ch 12-23`).
- For volumes the syntax is as follows: `v(ol)[number](-[number])`, again spaces allowed.

Examples: `2-12`, `c1`, `ch 2`, `chapter 3`, `v 2`, `vol3-4`, `v2c4` (note: you can only specify a single chapter with this syntax).
