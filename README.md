<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Tranga can download Chapters and Metadata from "Scanlation" sites such as 

- [MangaDex.org](https://mangadex.org/) (Multilingual)
- [Manganato.com](https://manganato.com/) (en)
- [Mangasee.com](https://mangasee123.com/) (en)
- [MangaKatana.com](https://mangakatana.com) (en)
- [Mangaworld.bz](https://www.mangaworld.bz/) (it)
- [Bato.to](https://bato.to/v3x) (en)
- [Manga4Life](https://manga4life.com) (en)
- ‚ùì Open an [issue](https://github.com/C9Glax/tranga/issues)

and trigger a library-scan with [Komga](https://komga.org/) and [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/).  
Notifications can be sent to your devices using [Gotify](https://gotify.net/) and [LunaSea](https://www.lunasea.app/).

### What this does and doesn't do

Tranga (this git-repo) will open a port (standard 6531) and listen for requests to add Jobs to Monitor and/or download specific Manga.
The configuration is all done through HTTP-Requests.
_**For a web-frontend use [tranga-website](https://github.com/C9Glax/tranga-website).**_

This project downloads the images for a Manga from the specified Scanlation-Website and packages them with some metadata - from that same website - in a .cbz-archive (per chapter).  
It does this on an interval, and checks for any Chapters (.cbz-Archive) not already existing in your specified Download-Location. (If you rename or move files, it will download those again)  
Tranga can (if configured) trigger a scan in Komga or Kavita, however the directory in which the Manga reside has to be available to both Tranga and Komga/Kavita.

The project doesn't manage metadata, and doesn't curate, change or enhance any information that isn't available on the selected Scanlation-Site.  
It will blindly use whatever is scrapes (yes this is a glorified Web-scraper).


### Inspiration:

Because [Kaizoku](https://github.com/oae/kaizoku) was relying on [mangal](https://github.com/metafates/mangal) and mangal
hasn't received bugfixes for its issues with Titles not showing up, or throwing errors because of illegal characters,
there were no alternatives for automatic downloads. However, [Kaizoku](https://github.com/oae/kaizoku) certainly had a great Web-UI.

That is why I wanted to create my own project, in a language I understand, and that I am able to maintain myself.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Docker

Download [docker-compose.yaml](https://git.bernloehr.eu/glax/Tranga/src/branch/master/docker-compose.yaml) and configure to your needs.  
Mount `/Manga` to wherever you want your chapters (`.cbz`-Archives) downloaded (where Komga/Kavita can access them).  
The `docker-compose` also includes [tranga-website](https://github.com/C9Glax/tranga-website) as frontend. For its configuration refer to the repo README.

For compatibility do not execute the compose as root (which you should not do anyways...) but as user that can
access the folder.

### Prerequisites

#### To Build
[.NET-Core 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
#### To Run
[.NET-Core 7.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) scroll down a bit, should be on the right the second item.
